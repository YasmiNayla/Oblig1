To start with I have experienced a lot of troubles at connecting my repository to my developer tool project. In intelliJ the commits and pushes has not been possible. I still experience this problem at this moment. The positive side of it is that I am learning how to use the terminal to write commands, even if it still feels bumpy and very frustrating. I basically needed the help of 2 TAs to get it done, so something is wrong with my computer I guess, specially since I still experience problems with it. 

When it comes to coding I started off with making the html page and the JS page. 
Thereafter I wrote on javascrip page.
